# LifeLoop Deployment Guide

## GitHub Upload Instructions

Since I cannot directly upload to GitHub, here's how to get your LifeLoop game files to your repository:

### Option 1: Using Git Commands (Recommended)

1. **Initialize a local Git repository**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: LifeLoop game"
   ```

2. **Connect to your GitHub repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Download and Upload

1. **Download all files from Replit**:
   - In Replit, go to Files tab
   - Click the three dots menu (â‹¯) 
   - Select "Download as zip"

2. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop the extracted files
   - Commit the changes

### Option 3: GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create lifeloop-game --public
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lifeloop-game.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: LifeLoop game"
git push -u origin main
```

## Environment Setup for Others

Anyone who clones your repository will need to:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up OpenAI API Key**:
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=their_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Start the game**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Play your LifeLoop game locally
4. Contribute improvements via pull requests

## Next Steps

After uploading to GitHub, you might want to:
- Add a license file (LICENSE)
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Create issues and project boards for feature tracking
